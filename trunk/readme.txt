== Description ==

Manage your site from a web desktop. Do multitasking with  windows, click icons, use notes. Jump to any place in your wp-admin quickly.

The system users will interact with My Desktop very much the same way they would interact with a regular desktop operating system,
but they work will be editing editing posts or approving comments.
